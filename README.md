# Data Structures with C++

📚 A personal learning repository to practice and implement **Data Structures** using **C++**.  
This repository contains my journey of learning, coding, and experimenting with fundamental data structures.

---

## 🚀 Purpose
- To strengthen my understanding of **Data Structures**.
- To practice **C++ programming** with real implementations.
- To build a collection of reusable code snippets for future projects.

## 📂 Contents
The repository will include implementations of:

- **Arrays**
- **Linked List**
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Circular Linked List
- **Stack**
- **Queue**
  - Simple Queue
  - Circular Queue
  - Priority Queue
- **Recursion**
- **Trees**
  - Binary Tree
  - Binary Search Tree (BST)
  - AVL Tree
- **Graphs**
  - BFS (Breadth First Search)
  - DFS (Depth First Search)
- **Hashing**
